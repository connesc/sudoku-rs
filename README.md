# sudoku-rs

This is a small personal project that I used to learn some aspects of Rust.

Goals:

- Define clean and efficient data types.
- Avoid dynamic allocations to experiment with Rust's zero-cost abstraction capabilities.

Non-goals:

- Implement complex algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles.
- Provide a real CLI.
